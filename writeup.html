    <h2>Major Design Decisions</h2>
    <section>
      <h3>Group Creation/Joining</h3>
      <p>
        One of the major design decisions was how groups are created and joined. In this app, users must be invited to a
        group in order to join. As a result, users choose group members at group creation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users can select people to join either from a list of other users that are already in a group with the user, and
        they can also type in usernames to manually add someone. Users can both select and deselect users during this
        process, allowing users the ability to undo any mistakes.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point, there's not support for adding/removing users once the group is created, but this is something
        that should be done (was time-constrained)
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, when users are added to groups, they automatically see the group on their homepage as well. Ideally there
        would be an accept/reject invitation structure, but that is left to be implemented later.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Displaying Messages</h3>
      <p>
        Another major design decision is how messages were grouped and displayed. For this app, users can enter/exit
        group pages, where the messages are displayed with the most recent at the bottom (consistent with most chat
        apps). Additionally, messages sent by the current user are shown on the right, and other messages are shown on
        the left (still in line with most chat apps).
      </p>

      <p>
        As of now, the webpage loads onto the top of the page, showing the oldest messages first. This is something that
        in the next iteration, will be fixed.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Page Layout</h3>
      <p>
        Another significant design decision is page layout. Every page is roughly the same, with a sticky header and
        footer, though the content in those change between pages. For example, on the homepage, the header displays the
        app name, profile pic, and login info. Inside a chat/group page, the header displays the group name, a back
        button, and (soon to be) an icon to navigate to the group calendar/availability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, the footer in the homepage shows the different tabs (groups, events, availability), while the footer
        in the chat page has a "send message" bar/button. This is inline with many other chat apps.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Intended Workflow</h3>
      <p>Another major design choice is the intended work flow, which is as follows:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Users who aren't signed in are redirected to a simple landing page, where they can sign in</li>
        <li>Once signed in, users go to the homepage to see their groups</li>
        <li>
          If users want to do something with a specific group, they'll typically go to that group's page, where they'll
          see the chat first and foremost
        </li>
        <li>
          If users want to schedule an event with that group, they can navigate there from that group's chat. They can
          also create events and look at multiple events through the Events tab on the homepage (not implemented yet)
        </li>
        <p>
          This workflow was designed to accomodate users' most frequent tasks. Although the unique aspect of the app is
          scheduling, most of the time, users will likely want to just message their groups normally. This supports
          that.
        </p>
      </ol>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Minor design decision - group display</h3>
      <p>
        A minor design decision includes many of the ways the groups are organized. Though much of this is not
        implemented yet, the design supports the use of timestamps (for the last sent message), preview text (to show
        the last message sent), as well as a ping/message count, which shows how many messages/pings have been sent.
      </p>
      <p>
        The groups also change color and cursor symbol on hovering to indicate that the group is selectable, as does the
        "create new group" button.
